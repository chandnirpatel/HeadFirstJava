Head First Java Problem 2 by Chandni:

Problem 2: Create a class that counts how many times you call the method increment() and prints out that number when you call total().
     
Please run HFJProb2 for an example where increment is called 7 times and total prints to console afterwards.
    
Assumption:
total() should return the number of times increment is called on the class Counter or an instance of Counter.
