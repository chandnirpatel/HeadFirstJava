Head First Java Exercise for Chapters 7, 8 and 9 by Chandni:
Create Orc and Troll classes that implement a Monster interface with takeDamage(int amount), String name(), and int currentHitpoints() methods. 
Store instances of both classes and store them in an ArrayList. 
Iterate through the list and make each monster take 10 points of damage. 
After you have damaged all of the monsters, report the name and current hit points of all monsters.
Orcs are named “Orc” and have 20 initial hitpoints.
Trolls are named “Troll”, have 40 hit points and only take half damage.
