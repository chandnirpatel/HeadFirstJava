Head First Java Problem 3 by Chandni:
Create an array of 5 Rectangles (each with height and width instance l variables and an area() method). Find the average area of the rectangles.

Please run HFJProb3

(I see that problem 4 is asking for an ArrayList and Rectangle constructor.  Please let me know if you want me to redo this exercise.)
